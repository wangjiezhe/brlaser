brlaser: Brother laser printer driver
=====================================

brlaser is an open-source CUPS driver designed specifically for Brother monochrome laser printers and multi-function devices.

While most Brother printers can use standard printer languages like PCL or PostScript, some models do not. If you have a monochrome Brother laser printer (or multi-function device) and the other open-source drivers are not working, brlaser might be able to help. Additionally, there have been reports of some non-Brother printers working with this driver.

Installation
------------

Some operating systems already ship this driver. This is the case for at least Debian, Gentoo, Ubuntu, Raspbian, openSUSE, NixOS, Arch Linux, Guix and Fedora.

Look for a package named ``printer-driver-brlaser``.

You'll also need ``Ghostscript``, in case that's not installed automatically.

Once brlaser is installed, you can add your printer using the usual CUPS interface.


Testing Other Printers
----------------------

If your printer is not officially supported, you can try selecting any driver marked as ``brlaser`` to test if the driver will work for your printer.

If you are able to successfully print, please open a new issue on Github and select "Report Compatible Printer".

When submitting the compatibility report, connect your printer to your computer via USB and run the following command:

``sudo lpinfo --include-schemes usb -l -v``

Please provide the output of the command so that we can add the proper entry for your specific printer model in the driver.

Example of output:
````
Device: uri = usb://Brother/HL-2270DW%20series?serial=000000000000
        class = direct
        info = Brother HL-2270DW series
        make-and-model = Brother HL-2270DW series
        device-id = MFG:Brother;CMD:PJL,PCL,PCLXL;MDL:HL-2270DW series;CLS:PRINTER;CID:Brother Laser Type1;
        location = 
````


Building from source
--------------------

To compile brlaser from source, you will need to have CMake and the CUPS development packages (such as cups-devel, libcups2-dev, or libcupsimage2-dev) installed on your system.

You can get the source code by cloning the Git repository or downloading the [latest release](https://github.com/pdewacht/brlaser/releases/latest).

To compile and install the driver, use the following commands:

````
cmake .
make
sudo make install
````

Note that you may need to restart CUPS before the driver is loaded and ready to use.
